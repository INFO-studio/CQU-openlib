## 2. What can I do

Nothing but coding. (Actually a rookie)

- If you are a **new C++ learner**(C++初学者),

  - Make full use of the "**The Guide Book For C++**" summarized on my own from my experience of teaching assistant. 

    【I am eagerly expected to hear from anyone glad to collaborate to improve the document.]

  - Moreover, look through my CSDN blog([LeoMooreCST-CSDN博客](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_65214650?spm=1000.2115.3001.5343)) to select some basic exercises to practice.

    ★**Attention**：Our initial purpose is for reference, not copy!

- If you are also from **College of Computer Science** and **struggling for final exams**(计算机专业学生),

  - Star my github repository([CQUCS-Study](https://github.com/LeoMooreCST/CQUCS-Study)), including **Operating System**, **Database**, **Principles of Computer Composition**, **Fundamentals of Compiling**, and other courses as much as you could expected.

    【I am eagerly expected to hear from anyone glad to collaborate to maintain the repository】

    ★**Attention**：Our initial purpose is for reference, not copy!

- If you are puzzled by  **Applied Mathematical Statistics for postgraduate** (研究生应用数理统计),

  - contact the author for some **summarized learning materials** and **organized** previous final exams, which may help you a lot!

    ★**Attention**：This item may not be totally free, since it  took a lot of effort to collect indeed.

- If you are confused about the **latest format of undergraduate thesis (**本科生毕业设计论文格式),
  - pay attention to my github repository([LeoMooreCST/CQU-ThesisWriting: 重庆大学本科论文撰写word及latex模板（202312修订，最新）](https://github.com/LeoMooreCST/CQU-ThesisWriting)), which is empty now, but we hope to make it available as soon as possible.
  - or just contact the author. 
- If you are interested in the research of **computer architecture concerning acceleration of artificial intelligence**,
  - We can communicate with each other and make improvement together!
